The main goal of this project is to predict the price of the Bangalore house using the data provided in form of csv file.

Bangalore House Price Prediction - Supervised Regression Problem

We downloaded the dataset from kaggle below link:
https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data

We made 2 Notebook files 1. for data preprocessing 2. to build ML model

we performed major all the techniques in the data science project here :
1. Load dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Preare Data for Machine Learning Model - (Data Preprocessing (Data cleaning, Feature Engineering, Outliers removal), Categorical Variable Encoding, Split dataset, Feature scaling)
4. Machine Learning Model Training
5. Test and Save model


PreRequirements to run this project: - 

- Anconda should be installed in the PC as it has all the required libraries for this project pre installed
- also Anaconda has certain softwares one of which is jupyter notebook 

open the 1. data preprocessing code python notebook file using jupyternotebook and then the 2. to build ML model

NOTE: part 1 data preprocessing is completed and part 2 building ML model is under progress
